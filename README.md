# DA401: Hurricane Analysis

*Author*: Peter Morley

## Introduction
This file serves the purpose of file documentation and as a README for the files in this GitHub. The project that I conducted was regarding hurricane analysis with a focus on time series and location analysis. Within this folder, you can find files regarding the data that I collected and used, code, as well as other important documents. The version of R used for the code is version 4.2.1. The version Python used for the location code was Python 3 which was used in a Jupyter Notebook. All other files are PDFs or CSVs so they should be accessible from any computer. 


## Data
1. File Name: caribbean_hurricanes.csv
* File Type: CSV 
* Description: This file is the filtered-down data that includes all hurricanes that fit my inclusion 
             criterion (latitude & longitude limits) for the Caribbean. 

File Name: clean_all_hurricanes.csv
File Type: CSV
Description: This file includes all hurricane data provided by the NOAA that I have cleaned. 
             This data ranges from 1851 through 2021 and has not been filtered down so all data 
             is present. 

File Name: hurricane_counts.csv
File Type: CSV
Description: This file includes data regarding the total yearly hurricane counts within the 
             Caribbean (1851 – 2021). 

File Name: yearly_pressures.csv
File Type: CSV
Description: This file includes data regarding the average minimum pressure and the minimum 
             pressure within the Caribbean (1992 – 2021). 

File Name: yearly_winds.csv
File Type: CSV
Description: This file includes data regarding the average and maximum yearly wind speeds in 
             knots for the hurricanes within the Caribbean (1992 – 2021). 

## Code
File Name: Project_Code.R
File Type: R Script (.R)
Description: This file contains all the code which I used to manipulate, visualize, and analyze the 
  	         wind speed and pressure over time for hurricanes. 

File Name: Location_Data.ipynb
File Type: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
Description: This file contains all the code which I used to manipulate, visualize, and analyze the 
  	         location data for hurricanes.
