# Hurricanes that have Hit the Caribbean: Time Series & Location Analysis

*Author*: Peter Morley

## Introduction
This file serves the purpose of file documentation and as a README for the files in this GitHub. The project that I conducted was regarding hurricane analysis with a focus on time series and location analysis. Within this folder, you can find files regarding the data that I collected and used, code, as well as other important documents. The version of R used for the code is version 4.2.1. The version Python used for the location code was Python 3 which was used in a Jupyter Notebook. All other files are PDFs or CSVs so they should be accessible from any computer. 


## Data
1. File Name: caribbean_hurricanes.csv
* File Type: CSV 
* Description: This file is the filtered-down data that includes all hurricanes that fit my inclusion 
             criterion (latitude & longitude limits) for the Caribbean. 

2. File Name: clean_all_hurricanes.csv
* File Type: CSV
* Description: This file includes all hurricane data provided by the NOAA that I have cleaned. 
             This data ranges from 1851 through 2021 and has not been filtered down so all data 
             is present. 

3. File Name: hurricane_counts.csv
* File Type: CSV
* Description: This file includes data regarding the total yearly hurricane counts within the 
             Caribbean (1851 – 2021). 

4. File Name: yearly_pressures.csv
* File Type: CSV
* Description: This file includes data regarding the average minimum pressure and the minimum 
             pressure within the Caribbean (1992 – 2021). 

5. File Name: yearly_winds.csv
* File Type: CSV
* Description: This file includes data regarding the average and maximum yearly wind speeds in 
             knots for the hurricanes within the Caribbean (1992 – 2021). 

## Code
1. File Name: Project_Code.R
* File Type: R Script (.R)
* Description: This file contains all the code which I used to manipulate, visualize, and analyze the wind speed and pressure over time for hurricanes. 

2. File Name: Location_Data.ipynb
* File Type: Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
* Description: This file contains all the code which I used to manipulate, visualize, and analyze the location data for hurricanes. 

## Important Documents
1. File Name: Final Paper.pdf
* File Type: PDF document
* Description: This file is my research paper which contains all information regarding domain review, methods of analysis, results, and conclusion. 

2. File Name: Executive_Summary.pdf
* File Type: PDF document
* Description: This file is my executive summary which summarizes my project as a whole. In other words a one page version of my final paper.
